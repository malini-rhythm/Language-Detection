# Language Detection Project
This project implements a **Language Detection System** using **Naive Bayes Classifier** and the **Kaggle Language Detection Dataset**. The model is trained to predict the language of given text input based on a dataset containing various texts in different languages.

- The necessary libraries are (`pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `re`, and `sklearn`).
